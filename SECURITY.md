# Security Policy

## Introduction
The **Secure E-commerce Platform** is committed to ensuring the security of user data and transactions. We value the contributions of the security community and encourage responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities to help us maintain a secure platform. This policy outlines how to report security vulnerabilities and the process we follow to address them.

## Supported Versions
The latest version of the Secure E-commerce Platform is actively maintained for security updates. Older versions or forks may not receive security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in the Secure E-commerce Platform, please report it to us. Follow these steps:

1. **Contact Us**:
   - Contact us immediately to resolve the issue.
2. **Details to Include**:
   - A detailed description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the issue.
   - Potential impact (e.g., data exposure, unauthorized access).
   - Any suggested mitigation or fix, if applicable.
3. **Submission Format**:
   - Use plain text
   - Avoid including sensitive data in initial reports unless necessary.
4. **Response Time**:
   - We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
   - We aim to provide an initial assessment within 7 days and work with you to validate and address the issue.

## Scope
This security policy applies to the following components of the Secure E-commerce Platform:
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose (`app.js`, `models/*`, `controllers/*`, `routes/*`, `middleware/*`).
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (`public/*`).
- APIs: Authentication, products, cart, orders, and payment endpoints.
- Security mechanisms: JWT, bcrypt, CSRF tokens, rate limiting.

## Out of Scope
The following are not covered by this policy:
- Third-party services (e.g., Razorpay, MongoDB Atlas).
- Dependencies not directly maintained by this project (report vulnerabilities to their respective maintainers).
- Non-security issues (e.g., performance, usability).
- Attacks requiring physical access to a user’s device or network.

## Disclosure Process
1. **Report Submission**: Submit your report via the contact method above.
2. **Validation**: We will validate the vulnerability and assess its impact.
3. **Resolution**: We will develop and test a fix, coordinating with you if necessary.
4. **Public Disclosure**: After the fix is deployed, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability with credit to you (unless you prefer anonymity).
5. **Acknowledgment**: Reporters of valid vulnerabilities will be acknowledged in the project’s release notes or a dedicated credits section, unless anonymity is requested.

## Security Features
The platform incorporates several security measures to mitigate common vulnerabilities:
- **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation**: Input validation (`express-validator`), output encoding (`escapeHTML`), JWT authentication (`middleware/auth.js`), and rate limiting (`middleware/rateLimit.js`).
- **CSRF Protection**: Tokens in `checkout.js`, `cart.js`, and `order-detail.js`.
- **PCI DSS Principles**: Mock Razorpay integration for secure payment processing.
- **Session Management**: Secure JWT-based authentication with bcrypt password hashing.

Thank you for helping keep the Secure E-commerce Platform safe!
